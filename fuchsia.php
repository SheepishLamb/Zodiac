<div class="artparagraph" style="text-align: justify; background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #8880 80%, #7ec1677a 95%, #8880 100%); font-style: italic; font-size: 13pt;">
&nbsp; &nbsp;Rolatide Inc was founded in 2020 in the United States, and started out as a basic pharmaceutical distributor. It wasn’t long before its founder, Everluce Pinnocle, reached out to colleges around the country about a breakthrough in treating memory loss in Alzheimer’s patients. Pinnocle claimed that he could use technology to stimulate the parietal, frontal, and temporal lobe to reduce and even reverse damage to the brain. None of the colleges wanted to take on the project without hefty financial backing, however, and Pinnocle was forced to put the project away for a few years while he searched for investors.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In 2022, Rolatide eventually struck gold overseas. Ji Xingping, the president of China at the time, had gotten wind of Everluce’s claim to “cure” Alzheimer’s and offered him the finances needed to begin work immediately, along with access to the top healthcare facilities in Beijing. The only catch was that Rolatide would have to move its headquarters overseas, and that Xingping was to receive first treatment. It was around that time that the public became aware of the president’s diagnoses.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;It took three years of research and development for Everluce to present Xingping with a plan and a pill. Unfortunately, we don’t know many details about the treatment Ji Xingping agreed to. Since his death in 2037, many of the documents on his personal life and illness have been destroyed - if they ever existed at all. The president had a very, very private life. What we do remember of him in the 12 years since Rolatide moved to Beijing is in fondness.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;It appeared to all that the Alzheimer’s treatment - later named ‘Rolactid’ - was working. The early anxiety he carried about his diagnoses seemed to disappear. Xingping was very quick-witted, enjoyed traveling and long conferences with other world leaders, whereas he would avoid them pre-treatment. For all accounts, Ji Xingping died of natural cellular decay in 2037 and Rolatide was successful in their treatment. 
<br/><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;While China mourned the loss of their president, Everluce Pinnocle and Rolatide Incorporated shot up into the medical and scientific world. Rolatide expanded their facilities to accommodate the soaring demand for ‘Rolactid’, as well as fostering other technology-based mental health treatments. Soon 2040 saw more products from the company - vitamins and supplements that fell under the ‘Rolactid’ line, energy-boosting drink Rola-Cola, social media applications for existing technology, etc.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually Rolatide branched out into their own line of wireless devices to help keep track of patient’s schedules and prescriptions such as smart watches and cellular phones. Newer versions of these devices adapted for social media and travel and leisure for the younger generations who didn’t need to keep track of medication.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;By 2050, Rolatide was in every home. It wasn’t long before Generation R(olatide) grew up and we began to question whether that was good or bad. What are the long term effects of taking a daily Rolatide vitamin or supplement? What information gets sent back to Rolatide when we use their social media devices? Who is watching through the eyes of Courtney™, the holographic assistant, when she helps us plan our meals for the week?
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;More than twenty years later, as the economy crumbles beneath us, Rolatide still flourishes in that lime-green light we’ve come to know and depend on. 
<br/><br/>
Generation R is Ready to expose the truth.
<br/><br/>
Stay tuned.
