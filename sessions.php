				  <li class="newpage">The Group has just been promoted to Year One rank in the Xicheng Hub - with it, is access to private quarters on campus, as well as discounts to supplies and a new dossier with missions.</li>
				  <li class="bug">They accepted the first mission - to locate Franklin Barry and the missing supply cache he was supposed to bring back.</li>
				  <li class="change">The Group visited Baita Si, a local Buddhist Temple that is having troubles keeping Rolatide from buying their land to erect a new factory due to lack of funds and structural repair costs to their aging buildings. The monks pointed The Group to Lotus Blue, a new bar that some of the Hub members frequented. The Group elected to pool together their personal credits to save Baita Si before moving on to Lotus Blue. Franklin was at the bar, but the cache had been sold off with Baita Si's troubles in mind. After telling Franklin that they themselves have handed over the necessary funds, Franklin parted ways with Xicheng Hub, leaving behind 10k credits he made from selling the supplies <i>and</i> a cryptic message. Willard made use of his USB drive to aid his research of the origin of the message and discovered a hidden article. The Group decided to try to trace the 10k credits on Franklin's card back to the seller. The Bank of Beijing reported that the transaction traced back to The Forbidden City. As they exited the Bank, an ambush unfolded!</li>
