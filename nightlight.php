R-BEV-77
<br/><br/><b>Objective</b>
<br/>Rolatide has produced a carbonated beverage (designated Rola-Cola) that is meant to target mood disorders and combat stress and anxiety in the average consumer. Before being allowed to sell this product, tests must be conducted over the period of 365 days to gather data on the effects on living human participants. The results from the tests on rodents have already been collected and documented in file R-BEV-75.
<br/><br/><b>Solution</b>
<br/>Three groups of 2 adult participants have been chosen to perform this test.
<br/><br/>Group A: Alpha. Group A will consume Rola-Cola at the same time, once a week, every week for the duration of the year. This is to determine the long-term effects, whether there is a permanent change - if any - in overall stress and anxiety levels.
<br/><br/>Group B: Beta. Group B will consume Rola-Cola only in times of heightened stress, anxiety, or extreme moods. This is to determine the short-term effects, and to get a sense of the instant gratification the beverage grants.
<br/><br/>Group C: Control. Group A will not consume any Rola-Cola during this test.
<br/><br/>We will also be conducting one-on-one and group therapy sessions once a week.
<br/>Group A will be given one-on-one sessions during the designated time they are given Rola-Cola, once a week, as well as participate in the group session later on in the week.
<br/><br/>Group B will only receive one-on-one sessions during times of heightened stress, anxiety, or extreme moods. They will also participate in the group session once a week.
<br/><br/>Group C will not be given one-on-one sessions, but are required to participate in the group session once a week.
<b>Result</b>
<br/>Rolatide reports that, aside from obvious health effects from consuming sugary, carbonated beverages at the prescribed rate, it would appear that the Rola-Cola drinks have had a sort-of Pavlovian result on the participants. Group B, when compared to Group C, have immediate turn arounds in stress, anxiety, and extreme mood swings when presented with the Rola-Cola drinks. We believe that they have come to associate the drink with positivity. This may be purely due to the sugar, but further tests are required.
<br/><br/>Group A, however, has reported fewer incidents of stress and anxiety, less accounts of extreme mood swings or manic emotions overall. Rolatide requests further testing for the results to be conclusive.
